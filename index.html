		<h1>Mentoring Groups</h1>
		<p>I'd like to join the JavaScript group to consolidate and further my knowledge. In the past I've spent some time learning through books and free tutorial sites but it wasn't easy to put my hands onto applying what I learned. I want to find out how to better integrate JavaScript with what I know about html/css.</p>

		<h1>Personal Projects</h1>
		<p>Last year I was lucky to have the opportunity of building two websites for small businesses (and earning some petty cash xD). It was the first time I built e-commerce websites on a CMS (WordPress). The experience was both thrilling and achieving.</p>
